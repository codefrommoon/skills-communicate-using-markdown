# Learning the markdown langage for GitHub
## A header smaller than the big first

This is a paragraph maybe.\
Because the file is a _.md_ file (markdown), this file may appear enriched by markdown.

###### The _smallest_ of __header__ in italic

Above is the smallest title. Don't forget to had a __space__ before the title.</br>
</br>

## Add Header
We can had an title from `#` to `######`
```md
# My title in big letters
```
## Add Image
We can had an image :

```markdown
![An image representing Yaktocat, a github mascot](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
```

Ex :</br>
![An image representing Yaktocat, a github mascot](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)</br>

## Add Code block
We can had code block for a choosen langage :

<pre>
```langage
mycode()
    {
        another_code...
    }
```
</pre>

Ex :

```python
# comment in python
import csv
df = os.open("mycsv.csv")
```

```c
#include <stdio>
int main()
{
    /* comment in C */
    int my_var = 18;
    return(0)
}
```
